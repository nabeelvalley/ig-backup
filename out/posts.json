So this is something that's been bothering me more and more lately‚Å£\n‚Å£\nEverytime I see someone post an even vaguely interesting picture on Instagram or on a WhatsApp group, or pretty much just anywhere, at least one \"photographer\" will ask in an infinitely condescending and all-round non-caring fashion - 'What settings did you use?'‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe reason this bugs me is multi dimensional (unlike the aforementioned \"photographers\") but I think it comes down to this - it's just plain degrading‚Å£\n‚Å£\nPeople somehow think that having a certain camera or lens or aperture or shutter speed is going to instantly make your pictures turn to magic. It will not.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nPhotographers spend years learning and practicing to do everything from holding their camera still enough to learning to focus and edit. For you to condense years of work, sometimes hours of planning, and the very essence of a moment that will never be repeated into just three or four numbers‚Å£\n‚Å£\nMerely using that fancy Sony with the 85mm f1.2 isn't going to magically make you a better photographer‚Å£\n‚Å£\nRespect the art that photographers make enough to not unnecessarily and incessantly ask them for their camera settings. Respect the art form that you've chosen to invest your time into enough to understand that it's exactly that - art‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe camera and settings don't make the picture. The photographer does",

Something you would happily struggle through, something that you can do - night or day - all night, all day - where every second you're not doing it makes you feel like less of yourself. Does having something like that give meaning to your life?‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£\nDoes my life mean anything then? Do I have something that I love like that?‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£\nAnd if I do, if there's maybe some long-lost piece of me sitting at the edge of the ocean,  do I become less of myself the further away I am from it?‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£\nAre we nothing more than the things we love?

It's mundane, an everyday scene, painted in beautiful late afternoon light.\n\nAnd that's what I want my life to be like, and I think I've managed that for the most part. I don't want to be someone who does amazing things and lives on a private island off the coast of Dubai or anything like that.\n\nI want the stable peace of monotony. I just feel like lately everyone around me is trying to DO or BE something, everyone is trying to be a unicorn, and I feel like everyone around me is trying to drive me to be the same, but I just wanna be the damn grass.\n\nI just wanted to be the sunbathed door to a Masjid, not the sixty meter wide dome at the top.",

It's a weird time of year from my perspective, this warm, relatively depressing part of a continent that's largely sad shrubbery and gold-brown sand becomes suddenly flooded by slippery purple flowers and and the most beautiful after-work sunsets\n\nSo last weekend, on Sunday evening, as the rain slowed I somehow managed to @nomaanhazarvi to join me for a photo shoot, and when we were driving to Brooklyn I observed just how weird these purple trees are\n\nNow of course I'm probably exaggerated in my perception of them, as it's probably not *that* unusual, but I feel like they belong in a completely different world\n\nI've been watching this series over the past week or so called Hilda, and it's an animation about this little girl with blue hair who, with her mother, moves from living in the wilderness to a city called Trolberg, the world is just beautiful in every way, from the tiny elves that are invisible unless a human signs a contract with them, to the trolls with these pointy noses that turn to balls of rock when the sun is out to the flying balls poofiness and a mad scientist whose weather predictions on the radio are suspiciously accurate\n\nAnd it's odd that, I watch this series, and I just feel like these purple trees that occasionally flood our streets, would feel so at home in this quaint little world.",

    "Caption": "I had a bit of a weird experience yesterday when I took the pictures off my camera to edit them.\n\nSo, I generally keep my camera in Black and White when I'm shooting, just because it helps me to see the light a bit more clearly, and for the entire day - that was just my mental image of what I had captured.\n\nAs soon as I opened the first image this black and white picture and it turned to these bright and bold colours.\n\nAnd it just shocked me to realize how the reality of things can be so vastly different to what they actually are, purely as a result of the filters that we impose on ourselves and the ways that we force our minds to see things.\n\nI think it's rare to have your expectations shattered so quickly and completely. Maybe it should be something that happens more often.\n\nFrom yesterday's InstaMeet #ExploreZA #DoritosBoldNation",

At the time I was shooting on my iPod Touch.\n\nAnd fortunately I managed to copy some to my Blackberry at the time (like for reals).
